(Tim Griffin)\r\n- *8:30am-10:00am*\r\n    Galaxy Tutorial – Basics of Data Analysis using Galaxy platform. (Dave Clements)\r\n- *10:30am – 12:00pm*\r\n    Hands-on session for proteomics data analysis using Galaxy. (Candace Guerrero)\r\n- *1:00pm – 1:30pm*\r\n    Introduction to multi-omics: proteogenomics and metaproteomics (Pratik Jagtap)\r\n- *1:30pm-3:00pm*\r\n    Proteogenomic analysis using Galaxy framework I: RNASeq data and sequence database generation. (Getiria Onsongo)\r\n- *3:30pm – 4:30pm*\r\n    Proteogenomic analysis using Galaxy framework II: Database search, filtering and visualization.
